## Bugs: open the issue before you fix it

Standing rule from the owner (2026-08-18) — **"กรณีเจอบักให้เปิด issue ก่อนทำงาน"**.

Before writing a fix, search — **including closed issues**, because a closed one is the
record that this was already resolved:

```
gh issue list -R yuthstyle88/108jobs-web-dev --state all --search "<symptom keywords>"
```

This repo is mirrored as `108-Plaza/108jobs-web` — search **both** issue lists.

If there is none, open one **in the repo where the PR will merge** (`Fixes #N` only
auto-closes an issue in the same repo, and trunk is often the mirror, not the org copy).
Title it after the *symptom*, never the fix; label it `bug`; put the repro and the
evidence that proves it (file:line, sha, the actual response) in the body.

Then carry `Fixes #N` in the PR body so the merge closes the issue — that auto-close is
the whole resolution record. One issue per finding; a batched PR carries one `Fixes #N`
line per issue it closes.

A finding that turns out to be by-design or a false alarm still gets its issue **closed
with that reason** — that is what stops the next sweep re-investigating it. A bug you are
not fixing yet still gets an issue; deferred work with no issue is invisible work.

Narrow exceptions: something you broke and fixed inside your own unmerged branch, or a
typo in code being written this minute. Anything already merged, deployed, or reported by
the owner is a bug → issue first.
